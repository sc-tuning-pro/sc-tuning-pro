# SC-Tuning Pro

## Overview

**SC-Tuning Pro** is the public-facing branch of the SC-Tuning project.  
We apply advanced telemetry analysis, intelligent tuning pipelines, and deep simulation-based validation to create **elite vehicle performance profiles** for *Forza Motorsport 7* (and future racing platforms).

SC-Tuning Pro represents the **polished outcome** of internal R&D conducted in the SC-Tuning Core system — bridging the gap between raw telemetry science and track-ready precision.

---

## Vision

- Deliver the **most accurate**, **data-driven**, and **field-tested** vehicle tunes available.
- Make **elite performance optimization** accessible to all players through public calculators, guides, and downloadable setups.
- Push the boundaries of what is possible with **machine-assisted racing telemetry** and **meta-analysis**.
- Build a **community knowledge base** that continues to evolve as cars, tracks, and player needs evolve.
