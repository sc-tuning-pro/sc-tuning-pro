# SC Tuning Pro

Welcome to **SC Tuning Pro** — where data meets precision.

This is the public-facing project hub for SC Tuning's work on telemetry-driven vehicle tuning, live performance optimization, and competitive multiplayer analysis for Forza Motorsport 7 and beyond.

---

## What We Do

- 🧠 Build real-time telemetry capture and analysis pipelines
- 🏎️ Tune cars for elite agility, rotation, and corner control
- 📊 Analyze G-force, braking efficiency, acceleration, slip, and more
- 🎯 Deliver tuning packs, calculators, and guides to the community

---

## Coming Soon

- 🧪 Web-based tuning calculators (grip, acceleration, Cat1/2 tuning logic)
- 📂 Tune archives and performance examples
- 📚 Open guides on telemetry metrics and driving analysis
- 🌐 Integration with sc-tuning.pro (site + docs + calculator portal)

---

## Relationship to SC-Tuning Core

- **SC-Tuning Core** is the experimental, internal engine.  
- **SC-Tuning Pro** is the distilled, proven result of that research.
- Only validated, documented setups and methodologies are promoted into Pro for public release.
